# Overview 

Remember Words was made by a dyslexic for the dyslexic. For as long as I can remember I have always struggled with spelling. This has slowed me down tremendously when writing papers or simple answers to questions. Like many of the people in my situation I had excepted my fait and solely relied on spell checkers and the internet to spell things correctly. These are fantastic tools, but they don't help with actually learning to spell. Because of this I find myself spelling the same words wrong over and over, ending up just letting the computer correct the problems for me. I didn't have time to still down and learn how to spell, but what if I could work on my spelling while I went around my normal life. That's where Remember Words comes in.


Repetition is a very important part of learning to spell and with Remember Words it gives you the opportunity tp get those reps in. The simple idea is to add words that you struggle spelling to the list and as you are writing you simply look over and type out the word that you are looking for which will give you the repetition that spell checkers can't. Don't get me wrong I still plan on using spell checkers, but as I spell words wrong I will add them to my list so in the future I can get practice spelling them.


## Getting Started 


Here is a link of me downloading and setting up the app.

<put link here to video on how to use it>

Above you will see a zip file that is called _download_file. Unsurprisingly that is the file you should download. In it you will find and exe file called remember_words. You can run the program form here if you would like or you can create shortcut and put it on your desktop, (I suggest the second, but you are free to do whatever works best for you.)

Once it is loaded the rest is pretty self explanatory. You have an add button in which you will be given the option to type in and add a word, or you can click a button to pull up a window to add multiple words at a time. The remove button will only do something if you have selected something. You can shift click, ctrl click, and just click and drag to select multiple words to remove. You will be asked if you want to delete the selected words. You will notice that you can not delete the alphabet. If you no longer want the alphabet to be shown go to the options button and select settings. You can choose to have the alphabet showing or not. In the settings there are also font types and sizes you can choose.

Under the option tab you will see a couple of other options. You can download the list of words you have made if you want to share them, and you can upload one if you have one from someone else. There is also the option to add definitions to words. This requires an internet connection since it uses WordNet through the PyDictionary library.

You can also hide the options bar and the bar with the buttons so the app takes less space on your screen. You can do this by right clicking on either one to hide them or right clicking on the list of words and it will give you the option to hide or show the options and buttons again.


## Potential Future Features

1. Change the color of the letters as they are typed correctly. This would help the user keep track where they are at when they are looking at the word.
2. 'Gameify' it. Make it so that there are rewards for typing out words that you have in your list.
